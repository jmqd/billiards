#+title: Open Physics Questions

* Is there cut-induced throw on a collision even at arbitrarily high speeds? Is
  it negligible at (let's say) a 20KM/H cue ball speed?

* Is the "gearing english" calculation correct?
For example, a 5MPH shot:

Half-ball (30 degree) cut: 6.2 rev/s
Quarter-ball (45 degree) cut: 8.8 rev/s
Very thin (90 degree) cut: 12.5 rev/s
